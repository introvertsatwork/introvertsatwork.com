Title: Early Memories of Introversion

----

Text: 

I sent out a questionnaire to /r/introverts a few weeks ago to start to gauge how satisfied people were with their current jobs, what strengths they think they had for them, when they realized they were an introvert, and so forth. 

It's a funny thing, coming to this realization. Many of us took Myers-Briggs tests in highschool or university. Some didn't make the connection until college, others until discovering Quiet. Another believed it to be a synonym for 'shy' until reading an article a few years ago. 

I didn't quite make the connection either until reading *Quiet*. For me, the realization hasn't become an excuse or a crutch, 

Goal is more visibility.
